CTMS,https://itclinical.com/ctms.php,"Monitors can create reports for Site qualification, Site Initiation, monitoring and closeout visits online. These reports can be customized if you
							have specific needs. 
						 QA Reports 
						 Quality Assurance can also centralize their work by filling their reports directly in the CTMS. 
					 
							 A shared file archive location is ideal to share clinical trial related documents with stakeholders. As a centrally located service, all users
								will be able to share and access important trial documents. 

							 Electronic Trial Master File 
							 A separate file section is ideal to create an electronic Trial Master File archive for your trial. Access to these documents can be restricted to
								the users you define. 
						 
							 The SOP section is designed to add, list and retrieve SOPs. You can use it to centralize access to your trial's SOPs 
							 With the ability to add files, this feature can help you centralize and share access to the relevant SOPs amongst all stakeholders.
						 
						 
							As in our other tools, the CTMS complies with regulatory requirements for electronic systems.  A thorough audit trail system registers every change
							in the system.  A flexible authentication and authorization system allows restricting access to the system and to the functionalities each user can
							perform.  By collecting data as electronic source data, transcription errors decrease and trial data accuracy is optimized. 
						 
					 
						 Do you have any specific needs in your trial? We can adapt our base product to meet specific requirements, tailoring the application to you.

						 The IWRS can also communicate with other systems automatically (including our  EDC System , allowing you to use ITClinical's IWRS tool independently while maintaining a communication with an external vendor's tool.  
					 		
						 The stock management is an optional module that allows you to register and track your trial stock  by registering movements (shipments and returns) and see movement history in the locations involved in the clinical trial (global and regional depos and investigational sites). 
						  Optional features within this module include the registration of orders to manufacturer, shipment/return PDF forms and location re-supply triggers. 
					 
						 
							By complying with regulatory requirements for electronic systems, it replaces paper based records which greatly assists you to access product information and records a long time after the trial is closed while avoiding manual searches.

EDC,https://itclinical.com/edc.php,"The eCRF module is the central unit of the EDC system. It allows users to collect and manage subject data and export it (including in PDF format for trial master file and trial report). 
	 					 Powerful Edit Checks 
						 Edit checks can be configured per trial to issue automatic warnings or to show/hide questions when relevance depends on the context. 
						 Online Queries 
						 Issue and reply to queries from within the system for faster turnaround times. The query tool can be used by QA and/or trial monitors to streamline the process and increase efficiency.  In-form query resolution improves data accuracy and streamlines the QA/monitoring process. 
						 One 
						 Extensive optional configurations per clinical trial study. 								
					 					
							 The Editor Module is aimed at CROs who want to have full control over the CRF implementation. 
							 If you prefer, our trained staff can take care of this part for you and provide you with the eCRF to fit the study's needs. 
					 
		 				 CRF Design allows you to design the eCRF, from how many modules (eg. Visits) the trial will have to the questions that will appear on each page. 
	 					 Edit Checks can be created for each question, triggering  various types of responses: show warnings to the user, show/hide other questions and answer other questions automatically.

						 Phase I trials possess different challenges when EDC is concerned. With shorter life-cycles and similarities between studies,
						CROs can take advantage of our Phase I module to improve productivity in the fast-paced Phase I world. 
	 					 eCRF libraries 
						 With the eCRF library you can build your eCRF templates and use them multiple times as the base for new CRFs with a click of a button. This allows you to set up a new clinical trial in minutes instead of days! 
						 Real-time data collection 
						 Retrieving sample collection times is performed in fast-paced conditions - usually with seconds between each sample collection for a volunteer group. 
						The usual eCRF view per subject is not adequate to these conditions. With our Phase I module, you will be able to see subject data grouped by collection point, so you can use the EDC in real-time, on the ground as you're collecting the samples!
						 
						 Volunteer database 
						 An optional volunteer database can help you keep track of all your volunteer data. This means faster access to volunteers and the ability to reduce data management of information
						you've already collected.","[{'titulo': 'eCRF', 'link': 'https://itclinical.com/edc.php#tab1'}, {'titulo': 'Editor Module', 'link': 'https://itclinical.com/edc.php#tab2'}, {'titulo': 'Phase I', 'link': 'https://itclinical.com/edc.php#phaseI'}, {'titulo': 'Regulatory Compliance', 'link': 'https://itclinical.com/edc.php#tab3'}, {'titulo': 'Adaptability', 'link': 'https://itclinical.com/edc.php#tab4'}]"

 						 PSUR Manager 
						  PSUR Manager,  the centre of PSUR management, includes historic information about a product's PSURs and  scheduling of new PSURs. 
						 PSURs are automatically loaded with the relevant AE/ADRs and the PSUR section templates are created and exported automatically to streamline the PSURs writing activities!
					 						
							 The Product Dictionary Module supports the Information and Reporting modules. 
							 Gathering the necessary information about the products for purposes of notification of an Adverse Reactions, the organisation can centralize the information of its Development and authorized Products. 
					 							
							  Part of the standard for reporting adverse events is the MedDRAÂ® thesaurus for classification of adverse events.  
							The thesaurus module aims at integrating this system of classification for seamless compatibility with EudraVigilance.
